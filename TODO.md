### Phase 1: Preparation & Foundation

*   [x] **Project Setup:**
    *   [x] Initialize Git repository and set up basic Git workflows.
    *   [ ] Set up the frontend framework (Vue.js for simplicity and rapid development).
    *   [x] Set up backend framework (Node.js/Express for simplicity and flexibility).
    *   [x] Define project structure, add linting rules (ESLint) and code formatting (Prettier) standards. Use Husky for Git hooks to automate checks on commits.
*   [x] **Database & Schema:**
    *   [x] Design a simple, flexible database schema that can scale (Use MongoDB for a NoSQL structure or PostgreSQL if SQL is preferred).
    *   [x] Create models/tables for Users, Workspaces, Projects, Tasks, and Comments using Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for PostgreSQL).
    *   [x] Add createdAt and updatedAt timestamps for data tracking.
*   [x] **Authentication:**
    *   [x] Implement user registration and login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    *   [x] Basic session management: JWT-based, ensure token expiration and refresh tokens.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development

*   [x] **Workspace Management:**
    *   [x] Backend: Implement simple RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, and switching workspaces.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Create UI for creating a new workspace and a fast, searchable workspace switcher (make it context-sensitive based on recent workspaces).
*   [x] **Team Management:**
    *   [x] Backend: API for inviting and managing team members in a workspace (keep it simple: email invites, no complex roles yet).
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement UI for sending and accepting invitations, with basic error handling for invalid emails.
*   [x] **Project Management:**
    *   [x] Backend: CRUD operations for projects via simple API endpoints.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Project grid view displaying title, status, progress, and avatars. Implement a "Quick Add" project button with inline validation.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Simple styling of project cards to maintain clarity (consider dynamic progress bars tied to task completion).

### Phase 3: Task & Collaboration Features

*   [x] **Task Management:**
    *   [x] Backend: API endpoints for managing tasks and sub-tasks.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Filterable task list for each project. Implement “Quick Add” task with an input field that auto-focuses for ease of access.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Task details overlay/side panel for editing assignee, due date, and task status.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Add visual indicators (tags/priority labels) for high-priority tasks.
*   [x] **Collaboration:**
    *   [x] Backend: API endpoints for posting and retrieving comments on tasks (keep it simple for now).
    *   [ ] Frontend: Task details view with a comment/activity feed.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement real-time updates for comments using WebSockets or Firebase (optional at first).
*   [ ] **Navigation & Search:**
    *   [ ] Frontend: Static sidebar navigation (keep it clean and collapsible for responsiveness).
    *   [ ] Frontend: My Tasks view for tasks assigned to the logged-in user.
    *   [ ] Backend: Implement simple search functionality for projects, tasks, and comments.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Global search bar in the header with debouncing for performance.

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Non-Functional Requirements)

*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement code splitting and lazy loading to ensure page transitions are fast (target < 200ms).
    *   [ ] Backend: Optimize API responses and database queries for <100ms on updates (use Redis for caching where applicable).
    *   [ ] App Load: Audit app load times to ensure the initial load is <1 second using Google Lighthouse.
*   [ ] **UI/UX & Usability:**
    *   [ ] Perform a UI review to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of use.
    *   [ ] Test user onboarding to make sure creating a project is possible in under 60 seconds.
    *   [ ] Perform a click-path analysis to ensure users can complete primary actions in <= 3 clicks.
*   [ ] **Notifications:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Implement a basic notification system (e.g., email notifications for task assignments).
    *   [ ] Frontend: Simple notification UI in the sidebar, allowing users to view notifications at a glance.

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

*   [ ] **Testing:**
    *   [ ] Unit Testing: Write tests for critical backend logic using Jest.
    *   [ ] Integration Testing: Write integration tests for API endpoints (ensure smooth user flows).
    *   [ ] End-to-End Testing: Use Cypress for full user flow testing (from login to task creation).
    *   [ ] Cross-Browser & Responsive Testing: Ensure compatibility on major browsers and responsiveness on mobile devices.
*   [ ] **Security:**
    *   [ ] Security Audit: Conduct a basic review of all endpoints to ensure no sensitive data leaks.
    *   [ ] Data Encryption: Ensure all sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.) is encrypted using bcrypt for passwords and TLS for data transmission.
    *   [ ] Use rate-limiting (via Express-rate-limit) to protect against brute force attacks.
*   [ ] **Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Hosting: Deploy the frontend to Vercel or Netlify for quick static hosting.
    *   [ ] Backend: Host the backend on Heroku or AWS (for easy scaling).
    *   [ ] Database: Set up production database with appropriate backups (consider MongoDB Atlas or AWS RDS for managed services).
    *   [ ] CI/CD: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or Travis CI.
*   [ ] **Launch:**
    *   [ ] Deploy to production and monitor application performance and errors.
    *   [ ] Implement a post-launch feedback loop for users to report bugs and suggest improvements.
