### Phase 1: Preparation & Foundation

*   [ ] **Project Setup:**
    *   [ ] Initialize Git repository.
    *   [ ] Set up frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) and boilerplate.
    *   [ ] Set up backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI) and boilerplate.
    *   [ ] Define project structure, linting rules, and formatting standards.
*   [ ] **Database & Schema:**
    *   [ ] Design the initial database schema.
    *   [ ] Create models/tables for `Users`, `Workspaces`, `Projects`, `Tasks`, and `Comments`.
*   [ ] **Authentication:**
    *   [ ] Implement user registration and login.
    *   [ ] Implement basic session management (e.g., JWT).

*   [ ] **Team Management:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Create API endpoints for inviting and managing team members in a workspace.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the UI for sending and accepting invitations.
*   [ ] **Project Management:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Create API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on projects.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the main dashboard project grid view.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Style project cards to display title, status, progress bar, and avatars.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the "Quick Add" project button and associated form.

### Phase 3: Task & Collaboration Features

*   [ ] **Task Management:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks and sub-tasks.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the dedicated, filterable task list view for a project.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the "Quick Add" task input field.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Design and implement the task details overlay/side panel.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Add functionality for updating task details (assignee, due date, status).
*   [ ] **Collaboration:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Create API endpoints for posting and retrieving comments on tasks.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the comments/activity feed in the task details view.
*   [ ] **Navigation & Search:**
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the static main sidebar navigation.
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the "My Tasks" view, aggregating tasks assigned to the logged-in user.

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Non-Functional Requirements)

*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Audit and optimize initial app load time to be < 1 second.
    *   [ ] Optimize all API response times and database queries for < 100ms on updates.
    *   [ ] Implement frontend code splitting and lazy loading to ensure page transitions are < 200ms.
*   [ ] **UI/UX & Usability:**
    *   [ ] Conduct a full UI review to ensure clarity and consistency.
    *   [ ] Test the new user onboarding flow to ensure a project can be created in < 60 seconds.
    *   [ ] Perform a click-path analysis to ensure all primary actions are <= 3 clicks.
*   [ ] **Notifications:**
    *   [ ] Backend: Develop a basic notification system (e.g., when added to a task).
    *   [ ] Frontend: Implement the notifications UI in the sidebar.

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

*   [ ] **Testing:**
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for critical backend logic.
    *   [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints.
    *   [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing for all user flows.
    *   [ ] Perform cross-browser and responsive design testing.
*   [ ] **Security:**
    *   [ ] Conduct a security review of all endpoints and dependencies.
    *   [ ] Ensure all data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   [ ] **Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Set up production hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Heroku).
    *   [ ] Configure the production database.
    *   [ ] Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
*   [ ] **Launch:**
    *   [ ] Deploy the application to production.
    *   [ ] Monitor application performance and error logs.
    *   [ ] Announce V1 launch!
