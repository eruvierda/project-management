## Project Management Dashboard PRD

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new Project Management Dashboard focused on speed and ease of use. The product will provide teams with a highly intuitive and responsive interface to manage projects, track tasks, and collaborate effectively. The primary goal is to minimize complexity and latency, allowing users to focus on their work, not on navigating the tool.

### 2. Vision & Strategy

*   **Vision:** To create the fastest and most user-friendly project management tool for high-performing teams.
*   **Strategy:** Prioritize core project management features, optimize every interaction for speed, and maintain a clean, uncluttered user interface. We will build upon the familiar concepts of workspaces and projects, as seen in the provided Aura examples, but with a relentless focus on performance and simplicity.

### 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Small to medium-sized teams (5-50 people) in tech, design, and marketing agencies who value speed and efficiency.
*   **Secondary:** Individual freelancers and project managers looking for a straightforward personal productivity tool.

### 4. Core Principles

*   **Speed is a Feature:** Every action, from app launch to creating a task, must be near-instantaneous.
*   **Clarity over Clutter:** The UI must be self-explanatory. If a feature requires a manual, it's too complex.
*   **Effortless Collaboration:** Make it simple for team members to see what they need to do and communicate progress.

### 5. Functional Requirements

#### 5.1. Workspace Management
*   **Workspace Creation:** Users can create a new workspace with a single click.
*   **Workspace Switching:** A fast, searchable dropdown (as inspired by the Aura example) allows instant switching between workspaces.
*   **Team Invitation:** Invite members to a workspace via email.

#### 5.2. Project Management
*   **Project Grid View:** The main dashboard will display projects as cards in a grid, showing:
    *   Project Title
    *   Status (e.g., In Progress, Paused, Completed)
    *   Progress bar
    *   Team member avatars
*   **Quick Add Project:** A prominent "+" button to create a new project from the main dashboard.

#### 5.3. Task Management
*   **Task View:** A dedicated, filterable list of all tasks within a project.
*   **Quick Add Task:** Ability to add a task from anywhere within a project view with a simple input field.
*   **Task Details:** Clicking a task reveals a non-intrusive overlay or side panel with:
    *   Title & Description
    *   Assignee(s)
    *   Due Date
    *   Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
    *   Checklists/Sub-tasks
    *   Comments/Activity Feed

#### 5.4. Navigation & UI
*   **Main Navigation (Sidebar):** A static sidebar providing access to:
    *   Home (Project Dashboard)
    *   My Tasks (a consolidated view of tasks assigned to the user across all projects)
    *   Notifications
*   **Header:** Contains the workspace switcher, a global search bar, and user profile/settings.
*   **Search:** A powerful, low-latency global search to find projects, tasks, and comments instantly.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   Initial app load: < 1 second.
    *   Page transitions: < 200ms.
    *   Task creation/update: < 100ms.
*   **Usability:**
    *   A new user must be able to create a project and add tasks within 60 seconds of signing up without any tutorial.
    *   All primary actions must be achievable in 3 clicks or less.
*   **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime.
*   **Security:** Standard data encryption at rest and in transit.

### 7. Out of Scope (for V1)

*   Gantt Charts
*   Time Tracking
*   Budgeting and Invoicing
*   Complex reporting and analytics
*   Third-party integrations
